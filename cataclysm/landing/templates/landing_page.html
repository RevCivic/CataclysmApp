            <p class="app_description">The stars as we know them have been torn asunder. 
                The constellations have shifted. The stars are now in an unexplored state. 
                <a href='/starships/starship?name=EternalVigilance'>The Eternal Vigilance</a> and it's crew have been displaced, and setting out on 
                a journey with <a href='/people/person?name=HugoWalgrave'>Captain Hugo Walgrave</a> to remap the stars, and find our way 
                back to the known civilizations of the Galactic Accord.
                <br>
                <br>
                The crew is made up of a diverse group of people, from all walks of life. Together they explore the newly formed constellations,
                and meet many new species and people along the way. They will encounter new planets, new factions, and new dangers. The perils of space
                combined with the dangers of the unknown will test the crew's resolve, and their ability to work together.

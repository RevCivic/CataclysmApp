The first invaders were the Xeenta, at the height of the Aleerin-Xeenta war. The Xeenta attempted to conquer the planet for resources towards the war effort, but were repelled by this (at the time) primitive species. They claim that there many others, but the only other one that there is proof of were the Ketraken. They sent in invasion fleet during the peak of the Second Galactic Civil War. The Ketraken leaders lost touch with the fleet as soon as they took up orbit around the planet. None of their soldiers were ever found. Their ships however can still be rarely spotted today, still crewed by Children of Phoon. First contact was made with them by an early expedition of the newly formed Galactic Accord.

After several millenia they began to focus their efforts more on making their world more hospitible. Some progress was made, and they slowly turned their scarcity to almost abundance. This further allowed them to focus their efforts on technological development. Then a discovery of Artifical Intelligence showed them that computers held superior reasoning and insight.

This lead to several wars, for the sake of battle itself. Millenia past and in the year 2430, when they were in their information age, great ships appeared in the sky. They were surprised by these alien visitors, and their militaries went on high alert. These ships deposited large armies all over the world. These large reptilian soldiers demanded their obediance and surrender. The Pahtras gave their response with a massive first strike. Though their people we never quite united, this new threat brought them together. However, this new found unity was not enough to stand against the physical and technological might of the Vesk Empire. The Vesk were impressed with the determination of the locals, who did not surreneder easily or quickly. Their defiance towards the invaders may have impressed the invaders but it cost them dearly. After nearly 6 months, the governments that remained surrenered unconditionally. Impressed by them, the Vesk did not rule them with their usual harshness, instead allowed some modicum of mercy. The planet's name was changed from Pulonis to Vesk 6. For nearly the next century, a stern resistance movement made the Vesk occupation costly for both sides. Then in 2514, at the hight of the Accord-Vesk War, the Accord sent special ops teams to coordinate the resistance cells into an outright offensive. This helped disrupte the Vesk occupation forces there to an attack by and Accord battle fleet. Within a year, the Vesk forces were brought to their knees and surrendered. The planet was renamed Pulonis, and they finally were free once again. Though very appreciative for their freedom, after decades of occupation, they needed to find their own path.

This also helped fuel their struggle against their Vesk oppressors. Since they are born in such litters, they try very hard to set themselves apart by perfecting a unique ability. When they reach puberty, they are taken in groups into the jungles and left to survive on their own and play wargames with each other. This does cause a few fatalities, but is a right of passage.

They are an aggressive species, always practicing their battle techniques, but they are not a violent people. They have a deep appreciation for music, and are all musicains in some form as well. They see synergies between their 2 passions; besides for artistic expression, they use music to coordinate battles and intimidate enemies. They also use various musical forms to tell stories of their ancient legends and warriors. They want to find a niche that they can excel in to set themselves apart and become legend. Once they form a bond they are loyal until death. Though their culture and planet were damaged during the long occupation, they are making strides to repair them with the help of the Accord.

They unified under a banner of common faith, one to the great god Zeff, a deity with many forms from the various tribe ideals. The Rochatan Assembly was brought about by a divine prophet, Varnak Yakra. While on a spitiual journey into a harsh desert, he was near death of thirst and hungery, when a voice came to him and said: \"Be well child, for the faithful will be rewarded in life and death.\" Then an oasis sprang up around him, like a miracle. In this oasis, he was taught to make paper and wrote the words of Zeff into the work that will be known as To the Path. After 10 years, he returned and united his people with this revelation. They began to build a new caste society with a renewed vigor. He brought a series of new technologies back with him, medicines, irigation, engineering, and sciences. He also came back with a new revelation, there are other peoples in the stars above, and they must bring the To the Path to them. Millenia later, their technology finally gave the ability to leave their world and eventually warp drive to leave their system. The caste system determines at birth what that child will be, based off of a ritual involving a type of fortune telling using a variety of sacred shells. The To the Path foretold of enemies of darkness would attempt to destroy or enslave them. As such, when they reach beyond their system, they already had a holy army to defend themselves. Now this was not a crusade, it was a missionary mission. They encountered a few species, some of whom were aggressive. They did not allow this to deter them and contiuned to bring their message of peace and enlightenment. Eventually when they met an Accord vessel, the Accord dispatched an ambassorial party, and they joined very quickly realizing they were a direct evolution of To the Path.",

They enjoy discussion, learning, and pondering ideals. They have several castes, with: priest, soldier, laborer, artist, leader, and emissary, to name a few. To the Path, is their religious philosophy. It is one that promotes peace, cooperation, understanding, and the strength of faith itself.

They also wear a rob over their other attire or armor that denotes their caste. They ususally wear simple clothes and jewlery, and use body paints to make religions markings on their bodies. They make excellent diplomats, counselors, and care takers. They get along with almost everyone, but find aggressive species as boarderline evil and weak willed thugs. Those who convert to To the Path, become part of the Rochatan Assembly, regardless of species, and have their caste then determined. They have one of the fastest growing faiths in the Accord.

The Vesk then began having the Skittermanders, pillage their own world of resources. Then during the Vesk-Accord War, in 2516, the planet is liberated by the Accord. To the amazement of the Accord forces, the Skittermanders seemed uninterested that their former masters had been removed and they were now free again. They seem uninterested in joining the Accord or changing the name of their world. They are just allies and protected by the Accord.",

Leaders are only made to complete the current task, once completed the group disbands until another task is chosen along with a new leader. They are single minded almost to a fault. They have an instinctual compulsion to help others. Once given a task they will complete it and then just find someone else to help. This makes integrating them into any command structure difficult. They are certainly non-aggressive, prefering to flee. However, when directed to, they will fight to the death. They prefer to use swarm tactics to overwhelm their enemies. They are very social creatures, needing to be around others. Alone for too long and they will loose the will to live. They have no sense of ambition or need for power or material wealth. They just like completing tasks. They have an unusual life cycle, starting out as a larva and then a small version of an adult with part of their larva form protruding from their abdomen, then that falls off and they look like an adult Skittermander. They have no family structure. They just mate when they want to, then once an offspring is produced, it is abandoned to fend for itself. They have no religion or ideals other than helping others complete tasks.",

Through the millenia, they studied and worship these ruins, slowly discovering its secrets. A whole religion was built around these ruins, making it their whole cultural identity. Because of this, their technological advancement was fast by normal standards, thus socially, they are somewhat immature by comparison. This alien ruin turned out to be a starship that had crashed on their planet more than 1,000,000 years ago. With what they had learned from this ship, they created their own warp drive, trying to find their lost deities among the stars.

This did not lead to wars or conflicts though. It only lead to a very increased speed of technological advancement. Throughout their history there were no internal conflicts.

This set the ground work for their developing culture based off of strife and conflict. As the millenia passed, and technology advanced, their tribes grew into clans. The clans grew into kingdoms, and the wars escalleted. Once into the industrial age, they had ruined most of their ecosystem with pollution and industrialization. With resources scarce, they began a 200 year long world war. This devistated most of their total population. From the ashes, a great leader rose and united the people under one government and instituted a new caste system. This was to divide the peoples to specific tasks that they would solely persue and strive at. Their inate competitive nature allowed this system to thrive, and bring a lasting peace. With their natural competitive drive in check, they set out to fix their world. They quickly realized they no longer had the natural resources to make such extreme efforts and began to colonize their system. Only 500 years after their world war ended and with the invention of warp drive, they leap out into deep space to make a coheasive and peaceful empire. They conquered several non-warp species in the name of bringing them peace and protection. Their powerful and highly trained military made easy work of anyone attenmpting to oppose them. After encountering an Accord vessel, which their fleet immediately offered to join them or else, a quick battle occured. Realizing the strength of this ship, its crew and their technology, they allowed it to limp away, and told them to return with the most force they could muster. The Tairox military was eager to finally have a potenially strong enemy to compete with and give them a good challege before they inevitably won. However, the Accord returned with 49 capital ships and hundreds of ultra lights against their 32 capital ships and a few dozen fighters. The Accord vessels out gunned the Tairox's nearly 8 to 1. Seeing this impressive display of might and the Tairox knowing they would quickly lose, an agreement was made between the 2 fleet commanders to send their single best fighters to the nearest planet and settle the conflict in single combat. The Tariox Prime himself went and the Accord General went himself. Unfortunately for the Tairox Prime, the Accord General was a well seasoned Gororian. The fight lasted 3 minutes. The Tairox Prime was shown mercy, and the Accord General decreed that the Tairox would come to the negotiating table to possibly join the Accord.

The Priest, which makes up their holy order dedicated to the Great Prime that united them in their distant past. The Warrior, that makes up their soldiers, pilots and naval personnel. The Scholar, that makes up their scientists, teachers, and doctors. The Artist, that makes up their artisans, musicans, and authors. The Crafter, which makes up their inventors, lead engineers, and craftsmen. And the Laborer which makes up the majority of people to keep their society functioning. There is no discontent with this system, as there is a mutal respect for each caste as one could not function without the others.

Early life for them was harsh, as the environment was not quite accomedating to life. To combat the dangerous creatures of their world, they became tribal for only a few millenia before developing a communal government of democracy. They never had any internal conflicts. About a millenia later, the Xeenta, invaded their world. Being a wise people, they did not initially fight back. Shortly after their enslavement, they began plotting a global rebellion. It took them only 50 years, to finish their plans. The Tishagas stormed the Xeenta's defenses and ships. They took their enemies weapons and a few ships, and began to fight back. The conflict was brief but very bloody. They drove off their invaders in just 2 days. In retaliation, the Xeenta bombarded their world from orbit. Believing they had eradicated the Tishaga, they left and never returned. The Tishaga did survive, but it took them many millenia to rebuild their population and their world. The stories of the invaders were passed to each generation, leading them to want to travel to the stars and find others like themselves who embrace community and cooperation. After a few years of space travel, they met a P'Shine' frieghter, who were more than pleased to meet and get to know these new people. They followed them back to their homeworld, and started negotiations. In their excitement they had the Tishagas sign an unsanctioned and unofficial charter, and sent it to the Accord Senate. The Senate reminded them, they do not have the authority to do this, and sent official ambassadors. They quickly signed and joined the Accord, officially.",

They are not easily diswaded or discouraged, and stand on their own marits of accomplishments. They are excellent engineers, diplomats, and physicians.

It defies all conventional standards and definitions of planetary characteristics. Throughout their oral history, they never had any internal conflicts or formal governments. By the time they had a written langauge, nothing had changed. Their only concern were the unusual predators of their world. They would band together to swarm, overwhelm, and defeat the predators. Otherwise they were content to go about their days in whatever way they wanted. To say they were free spirited would be an understatement. Little technological advancement was made for many millenia. Then almost as if a switched flipped, they focused their wavering and wondering attention towards extreme technological advancement. They advanced through 3 stages of advancement in 100 years. One day, a Toejalin decided he wanted to go faster than light. Within 30 years, he had succeeded. Then the Toejalins were let loose on the galaxy. Upon their first meeting with an Accord vessel, well this is what the Captain noted in their log: \"They are excentric, hyper, and pure chaos. They defy all logic and common sense. And they are an absolute danger to no one, except themselves. They have a charm to them that would be most welcome within the Accord.\" Still with no formal government or social structure, a representative was chosen at complete random and signed the charter as large as he could.",

They are a very peaceful people, violence displeases them greatly. They are capable of it, but will try almost anything to avoid it, including jokes, bribes, or just jovial behavior. They view everyone as a friend, and hold no suspicions of any other species. They do not hold grudges or take offense to anything. They have difficulty in acclimating to any sort of heirarchy or command structure, though some do serve in the Navy or even rarer, the Marines. Their jovial and carefree behavior can irritate some species who view them as incompetent, but put most others in good spirits and easly make others laugh, even unintentionally. Their defining trait is most likely their statisticaly defying misfortune. They are entirely accedent prone. Scientist have studied this phenomenon, and have found that there is actual evidence to show that the laws of probability are altered in their presense to cause accedents to them and almost always them alone. This can concern those around them, but undeniably it only happens to the Toejalins themselves. However, it has also been noted, that these accedents are never fatal.  They freely speak their minds, with absolutely no concern of the consequences. The only other thing they all have in common is that Toe is used in every name. They have no real family structure. Two meet, decide to mate, and the child is born with complete ability to walk and speak. Other than this, there is no commonality between them. No common sense of style, attire, hobbies, faiths, ideas, or culture. Each of them is completely unique. To have one as a friend is both hilarious and worrisome.",

The only change in appearance from aging is they get a bit wrinkley in the later half of their second century. They have hues of red, orange, or yellow skin. They have thick neon blue gelatin like blood. They have no body hair. They have no discernable head. Instead they have 2 long eye stalks capable of supporting several pounds.

During their industrial age, a world war waged, with each side fighting for their royalty to rule over all. Much of this time and before are known as The Blood Years. At the climax of the war, a weapon of mass destruction was used and millions of soldiers from all sides vanished in a blinding light. The survivors of that battle, from all sides, returned home and butchered their noble families, ending their leadership. Before the dust had even settled from this horrifying weapon, each nation's military leaders met and concluded that peace was need to save themselves from destruction.

As the many millenia passed, their technology advanced with them, creating a grand society of amazing architecture and dazzling art. Before creating ships to travel into deep space, they sent out a large amount of interstellar probes. They than began to built interstellar ships, ready to travel out into the stars. One of their probes was discovered by a hostile species, the Denzonites, who followed it back to the X'rentar's homeworld. The X'rentar's were initially unprepared to deal with an aggressive invasion force. They hopelessly lost every early battle, but their ingenuity and intellect would save them. They developed better and more powerful weapons and ships than the Denzonites. Not only did they repel the invaders, they followed them back to their homeworld. While there they strictly destroyed only their military installations, ship building facilities, and technological infrastructures, and hindered their progress for many generations. This set the Denzonites back to before the industrial age. Next they met a starship of the Republic of Unified Planets, uncertain of their intentions, and due to their last encounter with alien life forms, they deny any formal relations.

    "background":"Yazarians developed on a dense jungle world filled with colossal trees. It has 4 moons. They began living in these enormous trees, forming a tribal based society. They saw themselves as warriors, eager for any challenges. This lead to wars of superiority, throughout the millenia. Strong families began to take power of these groups, and the other were more than willing to follow. This lead them to begin an arostocracy. This government exists to this day. Their cities carved into the massive trees, quite a breath taking scene. Challenges of battles to the death became the way the settled disputes. After making sufficient technological advancement, the set aside some old grudges to loosely unite to dominate the stars. They saw themselves as master of their world and now needed others to bring into submission. The first species they encountered were the Muwattans who greated them in friendship. The Yazarian ships opened fire, believing they could destroy the Muwattan ship in the first volley, they were wrong. The Muwattan ship out manuvered them, though taking severe damage, and returned home. The Yazarians followed, seeing this as an even better alternative, believing an easy conquest awaited them. Again, they were wrong. Waiting for them was a Nea'talin task force, who repelled them easily. Furious in this disgrace, they sought another target. They next they came to were the Blebbles. Their small stature making them seem like easy prey. They assaulted and took a Blebble mining colony and completely destroyed most of their defenses, however a single ship escaped with survivors. They pursued this ship to destroy it and enslave who ever survived, but another vessel arrived, responding to the Blebbles distress call. It was the human ship the Nautilus. They were driven off by the human ship, vowing to never forget this insult. This lead to their joining the Union in the first Galactic Civil War, and the Union of Honor in the second. Towards the end of the second war, and after a massive decisive victory by the League of Planets, they withdrew from the Union of Honor and surrendered, realizing they were superior. After the war they became a founding member of the Galactic Accord.",
    "sociology":"They are an arrogant, prideful, and diligent people. They tend to be aggressive, though not directly hostile. They view timid species as weak or uncertain of their skills. They take an assured of success view to any task they take on. Each of them is taught the ways of combat, to ensure they are always able to take care of their enemies and bring pride to their family name. Due to their apparent arrogance, it is not easy for them to makes friends. This does not appear to bother them, but inside it does. They want to belong just as many others do, but do not know how to be any way else. They attempt to complete any task they take on, or achieve victory over any challenge. They have several customs that have paralells with the medival times of Earth, with powerful families, military might, and challenges of honor. They have a long standing grudge against Aleerins since the Galactic Civil Wars, because of several decisive victories the Aleerins made using superior tactics. Even after all this time, those stories are still passed down. Though they rarely commit acts of violence against them, Yazarians try to out do them every chance they get, even over trivial matters. They have a deep and complicated religion to a diverse panthology. The duty to their family is paramount, and care deeply for all within the noble house they serve. Their most notible feature is perhaps their collapsable double blade sword. It appears as a normal thicker scimitar, and with a quick motion, it is now 2 scimitars joined at the handle. They rarely wear shoes, and wear lavish regal clothes.",

    "background":"Ysoki developed on an Earth-like world with vast continents and few bodies of large water. It has no moons. Being very small as a species, they were easy prey for the large predators. As such, they quickly moved underground, becoming a subterrainian people. This was know as The Age Without. Due to their breeding habits, room and resources became a premium, and thus every few decades, a horde of pioneers would set out to find a new place create a settlement. Many would not survive the journey, falling victim to predators and disease. This would go on for a few millenia, each settlement out growing its location and a new horde would have to leave. This allowed them to slowly expand throughout their world. This was known as The Age of Wandering. Eventually they created the tools and tactics to combat their predators, and allowed them to begin taming the surface. They all would migrate to the surface and building large communities their, now no longer restricted by space. However, a small group chose to remain below, and would evolve to become a subrace. Meanwhile, more millenia passed, and with resources being plentiful, their societies and technology boomed. This is the time and era known as The Age of Plenty, when the cultural need to hoard became ingrained in their psyche. This is also when they founded their first religion. Being able to see the stars now, two of them shined much brighter than the others. They were alwasy so close together, that they took it as a pair of eyes of the \"Great Mother\" Lao Shu Po. Her cult spread throughout the world, as her disiples traveled and brought her word with them. This lead to their first war. This was known as The Age of Blood, as violence, depravity, and sacrifice became common place. This lead a small group of scientificlly minded to build sublight space craft, and launched into space. These would become the cousin species, the Finklar. Eventually, a mighty chapter of her more virtuous children, seeing her as a benevolent mother than a wrathful one, set about a crusade of purging unholy and disturbing practices. This was known as The Age of Apiphany. They gained large momentum and within 2 centuries ended The Age of Blood. Recovering from this holy war, their desire for more \"stuff\" increased. This lead to environmentally devastaing industry and cultivation. Cities started to become large heaps of what other species would call junk or refuse, but to the Ysoki, nothing goes to waste and everything has an intrinsic value. This was known as The Age of More. This lead them to begin draining the vast resources of their world and to scarcity. The awarness of limitation, sparked the Aquisition Wars, which lasted several centuries. This was known as The Age of Mine. With billions dead, and realizing they would need more resources, peace was once again achived by the great scientist and engineer Erd \"Bam-Bam\" Nert creating the first warp drive ship. Now with FTL ability they began to colonize their system and beyond. This was known as The Age of SO Much More. After discovering their 3rd system, they encountered their first alien species. Unfortunately for them, they were not peaceful, they were the Ketraken. Unimpressed by the Ysoki's hobbled together ships, they Ketraken invaded their system and homeworld. With their superior technology, the Ysoki were no match for the Ketraken's military might and cruelty. The Ysoki were forced to unconditionally surrender only after 3 days of battle. They made perfect forced labor for their Ketraken masters, who brutalized and tormented them. They were made to build large factories on their homeworld to add to the Ketraken warmachine, and manned harsh slave mines throughout their system. This was known as The Age of Pain. A small resistance remained and very slowly grew, as most feared for their large extended families. Still, the resistance managed to impead some progress, rescue some prisoners, and sabotage Ketraken ships or outposts. Many of the leaders of the resistance, were actually the subterrainian subrace, known as the Tyoki. The Ketraken never knew they existed. They were under the oppression of the Ketraken for over fifty years, but never once were they ever able to break the Ysoki spirit. 53 years after the occupation, Lakainin spies infiltrated the planet and made contact with the resistance. They took the intel back to the Republic, who, inspired by the disgust of the reports, immediately dispatched a battle group to liberate the planet. The battle was swift as the Ysoki turned on their former masters without hesitation. They immediately joined the Republic and eventuall became a foundeing member of the Galactic Accord.",
    "sociology":"They are a stubborn, gregarious, and greedy people. They are non-aggressive, but will defend themselves and those that are close to them. Their society is somewhat chaotic and have never had need of their own government. As such, when they joined the larger galactic community found the transition difficult. They needed to grasp the idea of a leader for longer periods than just runs for aquisitions. They needed to grow past their completely free-spirited and lack of responsiblity nature, to assume roles that would decide the fate of their whole people and other peoples of the Accord. All of them have an innate love of technology and tinkering, even in its most basic of forms. They also have an obsessive need to collect and keep as much as they can, including what other species would consider junk or trash. They never throw anything away, as it could be used for something or bartered for something else. They will go to almost any lengths to aquire more \"things\". These traits make them excellent engineers, adventurers, and merchants. If they felt slighted by any injustice, they would throw themselves at the problem, consequences be damned. This can get them and their friends into even more trouble as they hate being wrong. They have a childlike enthusiasm which makes other speceis underestemate them. They tend to get along best with other free-spirited or anarchic species, and try to shy away from domineering or aggressive species. Due to their mating habits, they have large extended families that they somehow are able to keep track of, and can usually find one relative of some distance at every major port. And they will be more than happy to map the whole family out for you, should you regretfully ask. They love adopting new slang into their vocabulary. And aside from their aquiring and occupation, do whatever they think is fun as much as they can. Their death rituals usually invovle all immediate members to consume part of the deceased. This way they become a part of them. Their religion to Lao Shu Po has died off in recent centuries, but still maintain somewhat of a following. Many have found new religions in other cultures that seem far more fun and interesting. They also have a latent psychic ability that effects their technology. Even they are not fully aware of this. For most of their tech will not work in any other's hands except theirs. Sometimes it should not even function at all, according to simple laws of mechanics. But if they believe hard enough that it should work or enough of them do togther, it will miraculously funcition, and they are not the least bit surprised. Hopefully they will never fully grasp this amazing ability, for should they ever discover its true potential, the galaxy will be plundered.",
    "physiology":"Ysoki are a mouse-like humanoid species that stand 3-4 ft tall and weigh 60-80 lbs. Males and females are almost naturally indistigushable to an untrained eye, except for small breast protrusions on the females that could be seen with the tightest of attire. They reach adulthood at around 10 and can live to be close to 80. Their bodies are covered in a fine fur, except sometimes their feet, hands, ears and\/or tail. This fur can be almost any natural color(s) and patterns seen in Terran house cats. They have a mice-like head. They tend to have red, blue, brown or black eyes, with black pupils. They do have poor eye sight, but make up for it in their hearing and scent abilitiy. Their pinkish noses are always twitching and have a series of long whiskers that come out of either side of the nose. These help determine if they can fit in a certain space even while blind. Their noses can decern between complex chemicals and scents. They have 5 digits on each hand that end in very small claws. They have digitigrade feet with 4 toes on each that also end in very fine claws and pads on the bottom for protection. Most wear boots to fit in with many other speceies culture, but when barefoot they can somewhat detect vibrations through the ground with their foot pads. They are also able to eat almost anything to gain even the smallest bit of nutrition. The undigestable portions are stored in a second stomach that they then reguritate up. They also have a long fine prehensile tail for balance and with practice, holding small objects. They have fine stubby teeth, except for their front upper and lower insicors, which are great for chewing harder objects. They also have an extra gland that helps to boost their immune system against natural diseases. Their pregnancies usually produce 3-7 offspring, with more being in the womb but being eaten by the others until only the strongest of them make it to full term, which is about 4 months.",

Only after many failures, within a few centuries, and with only a few hundred of their kind left, they succeeded. The first batch were stable and functional, but then they had the idea to improve themselves. They succeeded their as well. The new batch were soldiers and survival experts, physically superiour in every way. These new ones eliminated the first batch and the original Zaltarans, seeing them as inferior. They began to create larger and more spawning pools, increasing their numbers. They built a massive military industrial complex over their world, and set their sights to the stars to bring their glorious war to them. As they continued to build their forces, they expanded their empire into neighboring systems. They found 3 other species in their conquests and utterly destroyed them, hunting down every last one in a sort of blood sport. Then they would set up new spawning pools, on these now barren worlds. They would have continued their campaign of genocide, if not for them encountering the Accord. These new enemies were challenging and fierce. It brought them a brand new excitement on the prospect of total large scale war. And it did. The war only lasted a few years, but it was bloody.

They still bring their violently honest charm to their work and speech, usually putting newcombers off. They take great pride in being able to die in combat or defeating their enemies. They respect and honor their enemies, usually making and keeping stuffed trophies of their more successful victories.

The length of time this penance will last is unknown, and it is expected that one day there will be another war. They do not breed as other species do, they are grown in spawing pools. Maturation takes 3 months and the emerge fully grown. However, it takes a great deal of space and chemicals to continually make new Zaltarans, so they cannot easily create a new massive army.

Their society grew over the millenia, but they sustained a balance with their environment. They created large beautiful cities throughout the ocean floor. They expanded their artistry and philosopy, focusing only mildly in the advancement of technology. They never had any internal strife through their history. Roughly only 5,000 years passed, since they developed into their current form, they created advanced clean energy producing technology. This sustained them perpetually. Shortly thereafter, an idealology was created that asked: \"What is outside of our ocean world?\" This idea came when many of them began to have horrible dreams of the stars winking out in great explosions. They believed that there was life out there suffereing from their violent ignorance, and that they could assit with educating them in the ways of peace and community. Only 50 years passed since they discovered this new creed, and created their first warp ship. As it breached the emerald waves of their ocean, an intense battle already raged on one of their small continents. They informed their people, to be cautious as their world had already been invaded. As it reached space, an equally firery battle was being fought in their system. Their warp era had them emerge right in the middle of the Second Galactic Civil War. Fearing that they would lead these warmongers back to their people, the crew decided to leave the system and wait to see what these 2 sides did. Meanwhile, below the waves, their most venerable scholars foresaw a great explosion that devistated much of their world by the side that prides itself on a misguided sense of honor. To prevent this, and even though their only weapons were simple spears, nets, and tools for fishing and building, they gathered enmass for the surface. League forces had dug in tight, and the Union was preparing a large WMD to clear them. Knowing this, the League was still able to do nothing to stop it. Then, like a miracle, these beautifully exotic people charged from the beaches by the 100's of thousands. They swept over the clearly surprised and unprepared Union forces. Miraculously, the causualties were light. These natives took 99% of the Union forces down alive. The League forces thanked them, taking the Union forces prisoner, and explained the situation.

They do have a decent number in the Navy, though they prefer to be stationed on science, exploration, or support ships. They enjoy visual forms of expression, such as sculpture, dance, and song. Being social creatures, they prefer to be in larger groups, but can find alone time good for contemplation. They are complete welcoming of strangers in their homes, wanting to aid anyone they can. To have one as a friend, is to have a dedicated companion who will help guide you to the right decisions. Being that they also have latent psionic abilities, that boarders on precogniciant, they act as advisors and councelors to those they \"see\" as important figures. They have a close communal family structures, with the ideals that \"it takes a village.\" They have no true religion, instead philosophies of life. Twleve pillars of wisdom, that each one holds themselves to as best they can.",
    "physiology":"Zullians are an amphibious eel-like humanoid that stand around 5 ft tall and weigh around 100-120 lbs, with males being slightly more muscular in appearance. They reach adulthood at 17 years and can live to be around 150. They have dense rubbery skin that is blues, greys, or black in color, with complex colored markings of yellows, oranges, or greens throughout their bodies. They have a fleshy ridge that goes from the top of their head down the center of their back becoming part of their tail. Their tails are tall, thin, and long, similar to an eels. It is usually around 10 ft long. This allows them considerable movement speed in water. They have 5 digits on each hand and foot, which are also webbed to further assit with swimming. They have a variety of iris colors, with black pupils. They have a clear hard coating over them for protection. They have no body hair. They have a series of small spines where their ridge starts on their heads. Since they have no ears, these act as their sense of hearing. This can render them somewhat vulnerable to extremely loud noises. When over loaded they will shatter. They do regrow within a few weeks. Their heads end in a snout like mouth. They have a nostil on either side at the end of their nose. They have small sharp teeth, with protruding lower canines. Their tongues are extendable and are usually around a foot long. They have a series of wide gill slits just below where their ribcage meets. They have 4 lungs. They also have an extra organ in their heads that give them a limited form of ecolocation. This makes them highly aware of their surroundings.",

    "background":"Zypercons devleoped on a earth-like world, but with few large bodies of water, it has no moons. They began as a close community working together for protection from the large mammal predators. They had a slow progression of technology, but created a primative but stable democratic government. They also learned of their natural ability to pacify animals. This also stunted their understanding of conflict, as they would have no internal wars or conflicts throughout their history. As the centuries past, groups would migrate across the world, establishing new communities while still keeping in contact with the original. They would also keep a balance with their natural surroundings. At around 30,000 years after this form of their evolution, they finally began their industrial age. It was also at this time that they learned they were not alone in the galaxy. A question, that they never thought to ask, as they we content as they were. Drop ships decended on to their ancestral city, and strange giants emerged. They were heavily armed and ready for immediate combat. They announced that they were the Tariox Empire and were bringing this world under their protectoin and dominion, and that no objection would be tolerated. The leaders of the government came out to meet them. After a conversation that last only a few moments, they accepted the Tairox's protection and they Tairox agreed to leave on 5 soldiers on their world who would become honorary members of their people. Life continued as normal for them, learning many new things from their new residents. Things about technology, the concept of violence, the galaxy off of their little world, religion, and higher sciences. None of this effected the way the Zypercons lead their lives. If anything, they were saddened that people would end other people's lives. Less than a hundred years later, the Tairox Empire surrendered to the Galactic Accord. Ambassidors from this Accord arrived in peace, and explained they normally wait until a species invents warp drive before making contact with a people, but that because the Tairox had already contaminated their culture that they were welcome to join the group of different peoples working togther in peace to help one another. The Zypercon leaders quickly replied that the Tairox had not contaminated their culture, they enriched it with diversity, and that they would be happy to join a group with the mission of peace and cooperation.",
    "sociology":"They are a patient, thoughtful, and caring people. They have a strong belief in the santity of life, so much that they have evolved to become heravores. They are a pacifistic people, unwilling to kill unless left with no other option when threatened. They view other pacifistic species as kindred spirits, most other non-agressive species as doing the best they can but not quite as evolved, and aggressive species as barbaric primitives that need to be better educated to help them see there are other options. They make excellent diplomats, educators, and pioneers. They have a natural ability to put other creatures at ease, making them somewhat suspetable to suggestion. They never abuse this power, instead they try to use it to defuse situations and help others. There are species immune to this power, but there is very little research into any sort of pattern. They enjoy small arts and crafts in their down time, and are hard workers. They are just as content in groups as spending time alone. They have never had any religions but find them interesting. They a close community based family sturcture. Couples usually produce between 1-3 offspring in their lives. They where simple clothes, and no jewelery or make up.",
    "physiology":"Zypercons are a humanoid species that stand 3-3 1\/2 tall and weigh around 80 lbs. They are born into physical adulthood, but reach mental maturity at 12 and can live to be around 100. Females have only a slightly feminine form to distiguish them from males. Their leathery skin is gaunt against their frame, and is shades of greens and browns, usually with opposite colored hands and feet. They have red eyes with black pupils. Their ears are just small pieces of cartilage around large hearing holes on either side of the head. They have a yellowish brown dog like nose. They also have a proturding upper lip. They have slightly oversized heads for their build, with a slightly longer neck. They have no body hair, just hard chitious feather looking spines on the tops of their heads, shoulders, and forearms. Their arms are larger in porportion to their bodies, nearly reaching the ground with oversized forearms and hands. Their large thick hands end in 4 fingers, with stubby claws. Their legs are very undersized porportionally, and appear stumpy like and end in 4 very miniscule stubs for toes. Their stomachs also have a bloated look to them, to house a very sophistocated digestive system. It is capable of extracting 99% of nutriants from food. They have an unusually lobed brain, with a series of 12 smaller lobes than fewer larger ones like most species. They reproduce by a male and female reguritating a mucus like substance that contains genetic material and form a husk like brown cocoon. This cocoon then incubates their offspring. The offspring emerges fully grown physically after 12 months.",
